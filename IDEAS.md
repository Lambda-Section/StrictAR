Does some algorithm created can predicts gold price?

Hypothetical "Best Effort" Model

Data: High-frequency gold prices (e.g., 1-second ticks via Alpaca API) + sentiment from X posts (I can analyze) + economic indicators (e.g., Fed rates via FRED API).

Algorithms:LSTM for long-term patterns.
GARCH for volatility.
Prophet for trends/seasonality.
Ensemble: Weighted average of predictions.
APIs: Real-time data feeds (e.g., Yahoo Finance, X API).Optimization: GPU acceleration (e.g., tensorflow), parallel processing.
